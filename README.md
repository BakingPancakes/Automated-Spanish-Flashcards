# Automated Spanish Flashcards

## Overview
### Method 1
(parse text directly from text given by an API to construct each word's definition)
### Method 2
(create word bank, and use a dictionary API to translate each word)


## Organization tools used:
- Microsoft whiteboard on tablet to figure out data structure to store each word's information
- etc.

### Note on errors encountered with API response content
parseALl will be called iteratively on whatever files are in my google drive
those files will be saved to a json
json will be accessed and then used to display flashcards
keep in mind that it doesn't have to work perfectly, just that it displays determination, organization, and problem solving (that I'll show on the read.me)
it's ok to explicitly state the limitations, and how I tried to overcome them
